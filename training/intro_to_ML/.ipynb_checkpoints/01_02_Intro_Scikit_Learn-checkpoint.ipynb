For example, the \"raw\" data set may have numerical, categorical, and text data. Each of these types require different processing/transformations.

The `PCA`, principal component analysis, transformer returns a new set of uncorrelated features based on the original features while `SelectKBest` returns the k best features based on a passed criterion. For the example, the selector will return the 2 features with the largest correlation with the labels. When using `PCA`, the data needs to have zero mean. As a result, we create a pipeline object that represents the required two step process. We will have the `PCA` object return 4 uncorrelated features. The result of the union between `PCA` and `SelectKBest` will be a data set of 6 features. "
