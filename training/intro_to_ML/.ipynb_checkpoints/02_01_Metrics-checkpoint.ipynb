We choose a threshold probability, above which we will predict the observation is in the positive class, and below which we'll predict negative."

If our model were perfect, precision and recall would both be 1 regardless of threshold, so the area under the curve would be 1. If our model was always wrong, the precision and recall would both be 0 regardless of threshold, so the area under the curve would be 0. The better our model is, _regardless of threshold_, the closer the area under the curve is to 1. We eventually need to a choose a threshold and may choose to prioritize precision or recall, but the **area under the precision-recall curve** (AUC), is a very useful metric for assessing model performance in classification tasks."
