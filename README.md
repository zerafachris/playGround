# Top Notebooks:
1. [Sentiment Analysis for GitHub Page](https://github.com/zerafachris/playGround/tree/master/published/sentimentAnalysisApp/00_readme.ipynb) *2020-Jan* This notebooks serves to show: 
    1. A very simple sentiment analysis application built using [TF-IDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf) and sentiment classification using Logistic Regression,
    1. *Multi-language support* since the app will be language agnostic,
    1. Deployment and servicing of an ML model model on [PythonAnywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com), and
    1. Use of [Swagger UI](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/) to encapsulate the API.
    - You can try out this application live [here](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/zerafachris/playGround/master?filepath=published%2FsentimentAnalysisApp%2F04_interactive_sentiment_analysis.ipynb)
        
1. [Casino - Employing a Churn Prediction and Customer Value Prediction model to increase sales](https://github.com/zerafachris/playGround/blob/master/published/ChurnPrediction_CLTV/0_Overview.ipynb) *2019-Mar* In these notebooks I try and come up with a possible solution as to how an online casino could try and increase its net revenue.
1. [Machine Learning Templates](https://github.com/zerafachris/playGround/tree/master/published/MLtemplates) *2019-Mar* These are a set of notebooks I use to perform my first pass of model selection in a POC. They test out different sklearn models, tuning of hyper-parameters via GridSearchCV and finally create an ensemble of models to improve model performance.
1. [Deploying ML Classifier as an API using Flask (py)](https://github.com/zerafachris/playGround/blob/master/published/deployingML/0_readme.ipynb) *2019-Jan* In these set of notebooks, I put together an API with Flask to be used in production.

 
# Other Notebooks
## Data Science Projects
- [iGaming Analytics - Early Customer Classifier (py)](https://github.com/zerafachris/playGround/blob/master/published/iGamingAnalytics/0_readme.ipynb) *2018-Dec* Performed an EDA on an iGaming dataset and put together a Customer Classification Model.
- [Predicting the results for the 2018 Fifa World Cup (py)](https://github.com/zerafachris/playGround/blob/master/published/WorldCup2018Predictions/00_intro.ipynb) *2018-May* I tried using ML to predict the outcome of the 2018 Fifa World Cup. This project was not completed as I stopped half-way through the prediction modelling. However, some interesting result came out from the EDA and Feature Engineering in Notebook 2
- [House price prediction for the Maltese Market (R)](https://github.com/zerafachris/playGround/blob/master/published/maltaHousePricing/00_MaltaHousePrices.ipynb) *2017-Feb* This project was put together for the [Data X - An Introduction to Data Science: Storage, Visualisation and Analysis](https://www.um.edu.mt/courses/studyunit/las3004). This was one of my first attempts at doing DS work and utilised R.
<!--- - [Optimal Time to Call (py)]() This still needs to be published ---> 
   
## Visualisations and EDA
- [Malta Property Bubble Analysis](https://github.com/zerafachris/playGround/blob/master/published/maltaPropertyBubble/propertyBubble.ipynb) *2019-Mar* This is a mini-notebook were I try to quantify if Malta is currently (2019-Q1) in a property bubble. To do this, I use data from NSO and CBM and plot everything excel.
- [Efficiency frontier and Dash (py)](https://github.com/zerafachris/playGround/blob/master/published/EFT/00_readme_eft.ipynb)  *2017-Jun* This is an initial draft for an app which calculates the Markowitz's Efficiency Frontier for a Portfolio Investment Firm.
- [Chess analytics (R)](https://github.com/zerafachris/playGround/blob/master/published/chessAnalytics/ChessAnalytics.ipynb) *2017-Feb* Kingbase is a database of 1.8 million chess games which is freely available for download in Portable Game Notation (PGN) format. Using this data, I prepared a set of visualizations which summarize and explain information contained within.

## Miscellaneous  
- [Approximate Pi numerically using Monte Carlo Simulations (py)](https://github.com/zerafachris/playGround/blob/master/published/monteCarloSimPi/MonteCarloPi.ipynb) *2018-Mar* This is a very short, neat notebook in which I put together a means to approximate $\pi$ numerically using Monte Carlo simulations.
- [Hash Code 2018 Pizza Slicer Practice Problem (py)](to be added) *2018-Jan*
- [Simulating a queue in a post office (py)](https://github.com/zerafachris/playGround/blob/master/published/Queueing/Queueing.ipynb) *2016-Jun* At a post office, customers enter a single line waiting to be served by any one of two clerks. There have different probabilities of being served and I try and simulate the office's working hours.

# Training
- [Introduction to Machine Learning](https://github.com/zerafachris/playGround/blob/master/training/intro_to_ML/00_00_Course_Contents.ipynb) *2019-Aug* In this training course, I will bring you up to speed to the main ideas required for your to be a successful Data Scientist. The course consists of a set of notebooks that are split up into 3 parts:
    - **01\_##\_***: Introduction to Machine Learning Basics,
    - **02\_##\_***: Core modules required for Machine Learning,
    - **03\_##\_***: Specialist modules for Machine Learning
