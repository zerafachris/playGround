*This project was not completed as I stopped half-way through the prediction modelling. However, some interesting results came out from the EDA and Feature engineering in notebook 2*

In these set of notebooks I tried using ML to predict the outcome of the 2018 Fifa World Cup. This has 3 noteboks:
- **[01_Getting_Historic_World_Cup_Data](https://github.com/zerafachris/playGround/blob/master/published/WorldCup2018Predictions/01_Getting_Historic_World_Cup_Data.ipynb)** : Here I parse International matches to create a dataset.
- **[02_EDA](https://github.com/zerafachris/playGround/blob/master/published/WorldCup2018Predictions/02_EDA.ipynb)** :  Had a look at some exploratory data analysis and feature engineering
- **[03_Predicting_Fifa_World_Cup_2018](https://github.com/zerafachris/playGround/blob/master/published/WorldCup2018Predictions/03_Predicting_Fifa_World_Cup_2018.ipynb)** : Creation of an ML to predict the outcome.
