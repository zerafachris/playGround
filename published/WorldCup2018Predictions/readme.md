# Predicting the Results for the 2018 FIFA World Cup

This project explores the use of machine learning (ML) to predict the outcomes of the 2018 FIFA World Cup. The project consists of three notebooks, focusing on different stages of the analysis, from data collection to exploratory data analysis (EDA) and feature engineering. While the project was not completed, as I stopped halfway through the prediction modeling, interesting insights were derived from the EDA and feature engineering in **Notebook 2**.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project was to predict the outcome of the 2018 FIFA World Cup by utilizing historical football data. Although the prediction model was not fully built, the exploratory analysis and feature engineering provided valuable insights into how various factors influence the results.

## Notebooks

### 1. [Getting Historic World Cup Data](https://github.com/zerafachris/playGround/blob/master/published/WorldCup2018Predictions/01_Getting_Historic_World_Cup_Data.ipynb)
In this notebook, I parsed international match data to create a dataset of past World Cup results. This involved gathering and cleaning data from various sources to form a comprehensive historical dataset.

### 2. [Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)](https://github.com/zerafachris/playGround/blob/master/published/WorldCup2018Predictions/02_EDA.ipynb)
This notebook focuses on performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) and feature engineering on the historic World Cup data. Through this analysis, I examined trends, distributions, and relationships between various features (e.g., team strength, previous match results, etc.). Some interesting findings emerged during this process, such as:

- Performance patterns based on team strength and rankings.
- The influence of previous match outcomes on predictions.
- Key features that could potentially influence World Cup results.

### 3. [Predicting FIFA World Cup 2018](https://github.com/zerafachris/playGround/blob/master/published/WorldCup2018Predictions/03_Predicting_Fifa_World_Cup_2018.ipynb)
The final notebook aims to build a machine learning model for predicting the outcomes of the 2018 FIFA World Cup. While the model was not fully developed, initial steps were taken to prepare data and explore different prediction approaches.

## Key Insights
- Interesting trends and correlations were discovered during the EDA phase.
- Feature engineering played a crucial role in preparing data for the ML model.
- Although the ML model was not completed, the data preparation and exploratory analysis laid the foundation for future work.

## Conclusion

This project represents an exploration of predicting football match outcomes using historical data and machine learning techniques. While the model itself was not finalized, the insights gathered during the EDA and feature engineering process offer valuable contributions to understanding factors that influence World Cup results.
